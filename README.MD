# Observables Workshop

This project is a starter for Frosty's Observables workshop. In order
to get going, please follow the setup instructions below.

## In Step 5

This is Step 5 of this workshop. I have coded up some of the initial
work to make this app reactive.

## SETUP

-   `npm install`
-   `npm run start` // runs the webpack server
-   open `localhost:5000`
