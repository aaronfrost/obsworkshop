# Observables Workshop

This project is a starter for Frosty's Observables workshop. In order
to get going, please follow the setup instructions below.

## In Step 3

During this section of the workshop, we will be covering Subjects.

Subjects are Observables where you can add more data into them after
they are initialized. They are very powerful Observables that are
behind some of the more advanced things that the industry is doing
with RxJS.

The main Subjects that we will cover are

- Subject
- ReplaySubject
- BehaviorSubject (most common)

For this section we will be using index.html
