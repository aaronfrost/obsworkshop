# Observables Workshop

This project is a starter for Frosty's Observables workshop. In order
to get going, please follow the setup instructions below.

## In Step 2

In Step 2 of this workshop, we are going to cover two things:

1. Observable creator functions
   - Of
   - From
   - Interval
   - FromEvent
   - Any others you want to see? Just ask
2. Observable combining functions
   - Merge
   - Concat
   - CombineLatest
   - Zip
   - ForkJoin
3. Operators
   - debounceTime
   - startWith
   - filter
   - distinctUntilChanged
   - map
   - switchMap
   - take
   - pairwise
   - tap
   - Any others you want to see? Just ask

During this section of the workshop, I will show one of the most important
things about learning RxJS: How To Read The Documentation and Marble Diagrams.
We will spend a lot of time going over concepts and showing the documentation
so that the workshop attendees are prepared to look up some of their own
Observables and Operators once the workshop is over.

For this section, here is some mock data that we can use.
