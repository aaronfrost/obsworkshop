# Observables Workshop

This project is a starter for Frosty's Observables workshop. In order
to get going, please follow the setup instructions below.

## Setup

- `git clone git@github.com:aaronfrost/obsworkshop.git obsworkshop`
- `cd obsworkshop`
- `npm install`
- In one terminal window: `npm run watch`
- In another terminal window: `npm run start`

  - This is the terminal where we will see the output from our code in the workshop.

Once you have gone through these steps, you can start making changes in `main.ts` and that code
will be evaluated in the terminal.
